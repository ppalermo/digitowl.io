Email monitoring and automation can significantly improve business operations, but privacy concerns often limit adoption. Here's how to build a secure, locally-hosted email monitoring system using n8n and Ollama.

## The Architecture

This workflow combines Gmail's API, n8n's automation platform, and Ollama's local LLM to create a privacy-focused email monitoring system. Here's how it works:

1. Gmail Integration fetches new emails (limited to 100 at a time)
2. A code node prepares the email data for classification
3. Ollama (running locally) processes emails using the Mistral 7B model
4. Classification results determine automated actions
5. Matching emails can trigger custom actions (like deletion for spam)

## Key Privacy Features

- Ollama runs locally, ensuring sensitive email content never leaves your network
- Email processing happens in memory without persistent storage
- The system uses JSON formatting that strips sensitive content
- Gmail OAuth2 provides secure, limited-scope access

## Customization Opportunities

### For Client Monitoring

```javascript
// Example system prompt modification
{
 role: "system",
 content: `Classify emails as: 
   URGENT_CLIENT - Requires immediate attention
   FOLLOWUP - Needs response within 24h
   ROUTINE - Standard communication
   Return JSON with classification and priority level`
}
```


## Automated Actions

Forward urgent client emails to specific team members
Create tasks in project management systems
Send automated acknowledgment responses
Schedule follow-up reminders

## Implementation Steps

- Set up n8n locally or on your private server
- Install and configure Ollama with your chosen model
- Configure Gmail OAuth2 credentials
- Import and modify the workflow template
- Customize classification logic and automated actions

## Security Considerations

- Regularly rotate OAuth2 credentials
- Implement IP restrictions for n8n access
- Monitor system logs for unexpected behavior
- Maintain separate workflows for different security levels

## Next Steps

To enhance this system, consider:

- Adding multi-label classification
- Implementing sentiment analysis
- Creating custom action nodes for your business tools
- Setting up monitoring and alerts for system health

This solution provides a foundation for secure, automated email processing that can be customized for various business needs while maintaining strict privacy controls.
